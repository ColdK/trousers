# This is the configuration file for the trousers tcsd. (The Trusted Computing
# Software Stack Core Services Daemon).
#
# Defaults are listed below, commented out
#
#
#

# Option: port
# Values: 1 - 65535
# Description: The port that the tcsd will listen on.
#
# port = 30003
#

# Option: num_threads
# Values: 1 - 65535
# Description: The number of threads that the tcsd will spawn internally.
#
# num_threads = 10
#

# Option: system_ps_file
# Values: Any absolute directory path
# Description: Path where the tcsd creates its persistent storage file.
#
# system_ps_file = @localstatedir@/tpm/system.data
#

# Option: firmware_log_file
# Values: Any absolute directory path
# Description: Path to the file containing the current firmware PCR event
#  log data. The interface to this log is usually provided by the TPM
#  device driver.
#
# firmware_log_file = /proc/tpm/firmware_events
#

# Option: kernel_log_file
# Values: Any absolute directory path
# Description: Path to the file containing the current kernel PCR event
#  log data. By default, this data will be parsed in the format provided
#  by the Integrity Measurement Architecture LSM.
#
# kernel_log_file = /proc/tcg/measurement_events
#

# Option: firmware_pcrs
# Values: PCR indices, separated by commas (no whitespace)
# Description: A list of PCR indices that are manipulated only by the system
#  firmware and therefore are not extended or logged by the TCSD.
#
# firmware_pcrs = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
#

# Option: kernel_pcrs
# Values: PCR indices, separated by commas (no whitespace)
# Description: A list of PCR indices that are manipulated only by the kernel
#  and therefore are not extended or logged by the TCSD.
#
# kernel_pcrs = 10
#

# Option: remote_ops
# Values: TCS operation names, separated by commas (no whitespace)
# Description: A list of TCS commands which will be allowed to be executed
#  on this machine's TCSD by TSP's on non-local hosts (over the internet).
#  By default, access to all operations is denied.
#
# possible values = seal - encrypt data bound to PCR values
#		    unseal - decrypt data bound to PCR values
#		    registerkey - store keys in system persistent storage [Disk write access!]
#		    unregisterkey - remove keys from system persistent storage
#		    loadkey - load a key into the TPM
#		    createkey - create a key using the TPM
#		    sign - encrypt data using a private key
#		    random - generate random numbers
#		    getcapability - query the TCS/TPM for its capabilities
#		    unbind - decrypt data
#		    quote - request a signed blob containing all PCR values
#		    getpubek - access the TPM's Public EndorsementKey
#		    getregisteredkeybypublicinfo - Search system persistent storage for a public key
#		    selftest - execute selftest and test results ordinals
#
# remote_ops =
