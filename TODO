---- TODO ----

  TCS reading of the BIOS/IMA controlled PCR's and related config file changes.
    11/30 - system for adding unique event log sources added. IMA's is TBD.

  TCS Key Context Mgr.
    11/30 - keys are now reference counted, key loading and evicting is atomic

  TCS context handles should probably be random numbers, not incremental.

  Implement Tspi get event functions so that if ppEvent == NULL, only the
  number of events is returned.

  Make sure some GetCap call returns the version of the TSS software instead of
  a TPM version.

  User PS assumes 1 TSP context per-process. spi_context.c:119

  What to do when key->time_stamp loops?

  Setting a key's policy's secret after Key_CreateKey is called results in
  TCPA_AUTHFAIL. Make sure this is the desired behavior. If not, maybe throw
  some kind of error on Key_CreateKey, or throw a statment into the SNAFU's
  doc.

  Audit code for fault tolerance when reading in bogus data.

  Name ps functions rationally so that we can audit ps cache checking functions
  vs. functions that need to actually open the ps file on disk.

  Check for locking sanity. PS functions specifically with flock and
  disk_cache_lock.

  i18n work

  Get rid of magic numbers.
   - offsets into blobs
   - use NULL_{OBJECTYPE} instead of 0

  AIK path
   - Creation of a TPM identity
     - Source of the platform, endorsement and conformance credentials must be
     determined
     - Code path from TSP to TPM must be verified
   - Collate identity request function (encryption of the identity info under
     the CA's pubkey)
     - format of key received from a CA must be determined
     - Code path from TSP to TPM must be verified
   - Activation of the identity
     - Format of the statement received from the CA must be determined
     - Code path from TSP to TPM must be verified

---- LIMBO ----

  Support pLoadKeyInfo pointer in all LoadKeyByUUID calls.
   - Supported on the TCS side. Full utilization by the TSP has yet to be implemented. This
     was never supported by the windows TSS according to RCC. 10/21/04

---- 1.2 Timeframe ----

   TCS ChangeAuthAsym{Start|Finish}
   - According to the TSSWG, these functions have been deprecated. Look into these further.
   - These require a TPM identity, so therefore they're not implemented 04/14/05
