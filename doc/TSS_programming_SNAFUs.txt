Tspi_TPM_GetEvents

  Events in the TCS event log are 0 indexed.  So, a call such as:

	UINT32 five = 5;
	Tspi_TPM_GetEvents(hTPM, ulPcrIndex, 1, &five, &prgbPcrEvents);

  will get you 5 events (assuming at least 6 events have happened on the PCR) which
  will be the 2nd through 6th events on the PCR. (Since the 1st event is at index 0).
  This is probably what you want:

	UINT32 five = 5;
	Tspi_TPM_GetEvents(hTPM, ulPcrIndex, 0, &five, &prgbPcrEvents);


Tspi_GetAttribData

For an RSA key:

  Unless you create a key object manually of type TSS_KEY_TYPE_LEGACY and set the private
key yourself, the private key will be inaccessible.  Tspi_GetAttribData() will return
TSS_E_INVALID_ATTRIB_DATA. This is because the private area of the key and its auth data
comes back from the chip as a blob of encrypted data.
