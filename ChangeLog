* TROUSERS_0_1_5

 - Complete memory management overhaul. calloc_tspi is now used to clean up
   memory allocated by Tspi functions. TCS blob functions have been changed
   to not require a context, since there's no need w/o calloc_tspi. Its
   now necessary to call free explicitly everywhere in the TCS. In the TSP,
   calloc_tspi is now always called with the TSP context of the session, which
   would will ensure all memory allocated by the session is accounted for.
 - Unused #defines and variables removed from spi_utils.h
 - Commented out code removed throughout the source.
 - Removed log.o on a 'make clean'.
 - commented out unnecessary logging, added more descriptive logging
 - renamed variables named 'hContext' to specifiy whether they represent TSP
   of TCS context handles.
 - got rid of a few magic numbers
 - Bugfixes
   - in tcs/cache.c, getNextTimeStamp() was unlocking the mutex twice.
   - removed destroy_key_refs() in TSP, which caused double free errors
   - added call to event_log_final() in tcsd_shutdown() to clean up the event log
   - added an intermediate copy stage of data in getTCSDPacket() to avoid
   memcpy() calls with overlapping source and dest fields.

* TROUSERS_0_1_4

 - added ChangeLog :-)
 - TSP object management overhaul. All API's should be correct for contexts
    whether they're connected to a TCS or not.
 - testsuite changes based on object mgmt overhaul
 - various internal fixes and simplifications of the code due to object mgmt
    overhaul

 - added more complete destroy_key_refs() function
 - Bugfixes
    - quashed memory leaks in TSP found by valgrind
    - return TRUE/FALSE from getAttribData
    - added TSS_TSPATTRIB_KEYINFO_SIZE to Tspi_GetAttribData
    - call free() not Tspi_Context_FreeMemory() in spi_utils.c

* TROUSERS_0_1_2
